# Setting up your Cyboard
Your Cyboard should arrive with some charge in the batteries, and ready to pair.
1. Turn on bluetooth on the device you wish to pair with your Cyboard. It should be visible as "Peilert Cyboard." If pairing is successful and both hands are registering keypresses, you're done! If not, contact customer support at (+1) 518.813.0122 or erik.trinkle@cyboard.digital. You can also try some of the troubleshooting below.
2. If your Cyboard does not appear in the list of available devices, the battery may be dead. Try connecting the left half to your device via USB. A faint orange glow should be visible inside the USB-C port on your Cyboard, indicating that the battery is charging. If the battery was dead, your "Peilert Cyboard" should now be visible in your bluetooth device list.
3. If the battery wasn't dead, then the board may need to be reset. To reset, press the following sequence of keys on the left hand:
   1. Shortcut (A) + Cyboard (B) *(This accesses the "Cyboard" layer, which is used for bluetooth control, updating your keymap firmware, and troubleshooting.)*
   2. Reset (C) *(You can confirm that the reset occured by looking for 2 quick blue flashes in the USB port immediately after pressing reset.)*
